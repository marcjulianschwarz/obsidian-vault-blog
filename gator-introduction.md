A curiosity-driven, TIL-style blog post by Simon Willison exploring CoreWeave's acquisition of Marimo by researching and explaining what he didn’t know.

I poked around to answer my own questions and then wrote up what I learned as a short post. Curiosity-driven blogging if you like.

Relation between art/content consumption and art/content creation/production.

Gator is trying to convert consumption into creation by capturing consumed content, thought that arose while consuming and then offering helpful tools to create new and useful thoughts/content from the stored things.

> I've been in an existential crisis after reading Postman and I've since reframed the whole dilemma thusly: one of the highest aspirations for a person is the act of creation, and the result one can often call art. What is wrong is instead the routine consumption of art created by others in a stupor to rest from the drudgery of daily work. Create art, don't waste your life consuming.
