Found this cool app called [Equinox](https://equinoxmac.com) which allows you to create your own dynamic wallpapers for macOS. It's [open source](https://github.com/rlxone/Equinox) and you can download it on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/equinox-create-wallpaper/id1591510203).

Opening the app will prompt you to select one of three types of dynamic wallpapers:
- Solar 
- Time 
- Appearance

## Appearance-based wallpapers 

Appearance-based wallpapers use the current dark/light mode state to determine the look of the wallpaper.
To create one you drop in two images and specify which one the app will be using for light and dark mode.

## Solar Calculator 

Equinox even features a solar calculator to create wallpapers that match the position of the sun at your exact location. Here you will need more images but the results are stunning. You might want to check out this [gallery of dynamic wallpapers](https://dynamicwallpaper.club/gallery) to get an idea of what they will look like.
