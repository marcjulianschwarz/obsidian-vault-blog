# A tour through my second brain

For about half a year now I have been taking notes with Obsidian, an application that lets you write notes based on local markdown files.  But it is no standard note taking app, Obsidian promotes the idea of linked thinking which means linking thoughts and knowledge by linking different notes. In this blog post I would like to share the experience I had with my *Personal Knowledge Management* (PKM) system until today.

I mostly use Obsidian to take notes on [[020 - Uni|university]] lectures while adding my own thoughts or quotes from professors to those lecture notes. They now make up 610 notes.

With all of this knowledge and information in my vault, nearly all of my new lecture notes that I am taking automatically link to other related notes. Sometimes I don't even have to write anything down because I could explain the subject just by linking lots of atomic notes (notes that only cover one concept) together which I wrote down in the course of the earlier semesters.

One of the many great features of Obsidian are backlinks and s

Connections are now starting to emerge out of nowhere and sometimes 
where before I wouldn’t even think of connecting them manually. This allows me to fin
I guess there is some non-definable threshold of notes that you have to take on a topic from where on the vault kind of starts “connecting itself”, which is beautiful.


## Systems that I am using

I don't use a single system or approach however I do enjoy the concept of atomic notes as it makes them reusable. To still get hold of one specific topic, so called MOCs (Maps of Content) can be used to have all relevant notes easily accessible at one place.
Besides those two methods a normal folder structure can help to organize a vault. Mine is heavily influenced by daily routines like university, sports, projects, blog, health, bible study, ...

Additionally I ... a "Black Hole" which is an ever growing folder of things that I wrote down  for the case that they might be handy in the future.

I think a ZK and overall PKM is a great way to keep the overview when studying at [[020 - Uni|uni]]. Constantly adding tiny bits to the system will make it very valuable. Often better than any script because it is all boiled down to the essential parts.

In the end I often use my own notes to learn for exams, thats why I plan on creating a subsystem to create notes specifically for that purpose, for example writing down questions with answers, or important things that the prof mentioned, etc.



## My Folder structure 

The folder structure of my vault is relatively flat with few folders and files on the top level. 

My folders are numerated from *000* to *090*.

The *000* folders play a special role as they contain various files which will be used by plugins. `000 Dictionaries` contains dictionary files for *Various Complements*, an auto-complete plugin. It contains templates for LaTeX, YAML frontmatters and other things.
`000 Templates` contain files to be used as note templates. 

Folder *010* is the **Black Hole** (or *Inbox* if you are not a space guy). It contains all sorts of notes on every kind of topic. If I find something interesting and worth a note, it will go into this folder. It is completely flat. 

All other numbered folders divide my vault into the main topics that I write notes on.

In my case those are:
- Uni 
- Work 
- Projects 
- Privat 
- Blog 
- Bibel 
- Data Science 


Additionally I have a few top level files which serve as entry points to the various topics.




## Thoughts on Internalizing knowledge from a PKM

I wouldn't say that I completely internalized the knowledge of all of my notes. But this is the part where Obsidian helps me out by storing **my** knowledge and making it very accessible to **me**. In my opinion there is a big difference in e.g. Wikipedia storing knowledge and yourself writing it down in your own words. 
However to really internalize everything you still have to sit down and learn (better: apply) the things.  
So to sum it all up, I don't think that the main promise of taking notes is to think about the topic you are writing about which will make it easier to remember it. 

You can also think of it being more of an extension of your brain that you can quickly access and interact with. Especially the "interaction" part plays a big role for me since I think that it is easier or has less friction involved moving thoughts, ideas or knowledge "physically" instead of wrangling with them in your head. And by writing everything down, nothing gets lost down the road. 
One last point I want to add is that everyone will (or should) have their own (or a to their needs adapted) system, again to engage interactivity and flexibility concerning the movement or linking of thoughts, ideas or knowledge.

In the end I think it's to aid digestion - maybe speed up the absorption of the knowledge nutrients into your mind gut. Maybe you are subconsciously internalizing it too.

That could definitely be true. I can only talk from my experience but the „to aid digestion“ part holds for me.


## Obsidian Themes 
- Minimal 

## Obsidian Plugins 

The probably most important and useful feature of Obsidian is its extendability through plugins. 


Here are the ones I use:

### Advanced Tables

The Advanced Tables plugin is a quality of life improvement. It lets you use markdown tables in the way you might use Excel tables. This means you can navigate using `Tab` and `Enter` keys.


### Backlinks 

???


### [[betterfilelink]]

The Better File Link plugin adds a simple UI which you can use to add links to local files. With the ability to add a template in the settings you can create whole lists of links in your notes.

### Dataview

Dataview is one of the most powerful plugins available for Obsidian. It will transform your vault into a database that you can query with SQL-like syntax. 
Additionally you can use JavaScript to query the database to create elaborate dashboards.



### Hider

I use the Hider plugin to hide some of the distracting UI of Obsidian to give it a cleaner and more modern looking feel.
I am hiding the title bar, app ribbon, status bar, vault name, scroll bars, tooltips, instructions and the metadata block for when I am in reading mode.


### Icon Folder

The Icon Folder plugin adds as the name suggests icons to folders. 


### Kanban 

This plugins is for everyone working on one or multiple projects and people who are in need of a better way to organize their projects.


### Minimal Theme Settings 

As I was writing above, I am using the Minimal Theme. It ships with a plugin called Minimal Theme Settings which can be used to further customize the theme.



### Note Refactor

Note Refactor is a core plugin which means you dont have to install it from the community list, you just have to enable it in settings.

I use the keyboard shortcut `shift + cmd + r` to trigger it.

The templates:

```
{{new_note_link}}
```

```
# {{new_note_content}}
```


- Page preview
- Quick switcher

### QuickAdd

Link to Bible verses. → Link to both web scraper script and quickadd script (GitHub?)


### Sliding Panes

Link to Andys site.

### Smart Typography


### Spaced Repetition 

Anki-like flashcard system right within your notes. *→ link to Spaced repetition blog *post.

### Style Settings 

This plugin goes hand in hand with the Minimal Theme Settings plugin/theme.


### Templates 


### Various Complements 


### Omni Search
