This week I had my **1-year anniversary** at AHEAD Automotive. In this short time we built an entire product from scratch, which is now used by over 60 car workshops in Germany and soon released for everyone. The product, called [Qira](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qira-ai/), is the intelligent assistant for the automotive aftermarket. Qira combines detailed repair information from data providers and original car manufacturers at a single point of access. With a simple natural language input field, car mechanics can ask Qira for

- detailed vehicle data 🚗  
- lubricants 💧  
- component locations 📍  
- repair manuals 🔧  
- recalls ⚠️  
- technical drawings 📝  
- and much more...  

Qira also interprets error codes to precisely describe their symptoms, causes and effects. Qira can predict affected components and suggests solutions based on past reports with the same error code. Qira will even guide users through step by step diagnosis instructions to accurately pin down faults in electrical components.  
  
All answers by Qira use reliable data sources and we made sure that our systems can not alter the provided information, so you can always be sure to get the most up to date and accurate information.

I am proud that our hard work can now see the light of day and that Qira is already [assisting car mechanics with their daily work.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/qira-ai_werkstattzukunft-qira-ki-activity-7310308463698411521-s56_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFZNsFoBY9zXWmwyaotjwH3DzubIQ945gsk)
