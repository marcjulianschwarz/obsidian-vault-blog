## Graph View 

![Whole Graph](/images/graph_full.jpg)

This is the knowledge graph of my second brain. It stores ideas, thought and knowledge. 

The colors represent individual groups which can be defined via folders, tags or keywords. 
In my case the colors represent overarching topics:
- Green → University Notes 
- Blue → Bible Study Notes 
- Red → Other (Black Hole, Projects, Blog, Private)



Zooming in reveals the complex graph structure with all of its links between notes of different topics.

Zooming in even further makes the notes names readable and distinct links can be seen.

At this level you can clearly see how various notes are connected.

## Local Graph 

The local graph allows you to see only parts of the graph that are connected to a specific note. 
The following image shows a local graph for the note *Random Variable* with a depth of 2 which means that only nodes with a distance of up to 2 edges will be displayed.
This can be helpful to quickly navigate to notes from the same topic.
