Ever wanted to share a nicely rendered markdown snippet with someone? Now you can, with [mdnsip.com](http://mdnsip.com).

Lately, I have been writing a lot of tiny markdown snippets in Obsidian. These can range from simple code snippets to short documentation of some functionality or longer notes on topics that I am currently working on.

Sometimes I want to share one of my markdown snippets with a colleague. However, all of the ways of doing this have resulted in various issues. Many chat or email apps actually do not support markdown syntax. And if they do support it, they often use some kind of proprietary syntax or apply confusing styling to the markdown elements.

## Enter Markdown

Here you can enter markdown on the left and it will show you a preview of the rendered content on the right side. You can then change settings and copy the mdsnip link.
