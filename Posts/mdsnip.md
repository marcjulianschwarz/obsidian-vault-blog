The web app [mdnsip.com](http://mdnsip.com) let's users share markdown snippets with nice rendering, expiration times and download options via a simple unique URL.

Markdown is great but most communication apps either don't support it, use some kind of proprietary syntax or apply confusing styling to markdown elements. And once shared over such an app, the markdown behind the rendered output is often lost and not available to the receiving user.

mdsnip.com is here to solve this once and for all. You enter markdown, set an expiration time and click share. Your clipboard should now include a nice short URL that directly links to a rendered view of the markdown snippet. Users with the link can view the snippet and download the markdown or html if needed.

It's as simple as that.

If you need more options and a place to look through your stored snippets, you can simply login with a username and password.
