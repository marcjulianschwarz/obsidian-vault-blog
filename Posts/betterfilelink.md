# Better File Link

I created the *Better File Link* plugin for the note taking app [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to make local file links more accessible. It features an interface to select files right from within Obsidian. No need to open a new Finder/File Explorer window to manually drag and drop files to your note.

You can find it in the official community plugins list right in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcjulianschwarz/obsidian-file-link).

## Other features and settings to improve file links:
+ custom prefix shown before every file link when adding multiple files
+ toggle visibility of file endings
+ decide whether the file or the folder containing the selected file should be linked
+ choose to embed files in the note instead of only linking it

## These file types are supported for embedding:
+ Markdown: **md**
+ Images: **png**, **jpg**, **jpeg**, **gif**, **bmp**, **svg**
+ Audio: **mp3**, **webm**, **wav**, **m4a**, **ogg**, **3gp**, **flac**
+ Video: **mp4**, **webm**, **ogv**
+ PDF: **pdf**
