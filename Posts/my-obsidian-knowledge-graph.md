## Graph View 

![Whole Graph](/images/graph_full.jpg)

This is the knowledge graph of my second brain, markdown notes written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It stores ideas, thoughts, and knowledge.

The colors represent individual groups that can be defined via folders, tags, or keywords. In my case, the colors represent overarching topics:

-  Green → University Notes
-  Blue → Bible Study Notes
-  Red → Other (Inbox, Projects, Blog, Private)

Zooming in reveals the more complex graph structure with all of its links between notes of different topics; the note names become readable, and distinct links can be seen.

At this level, you can clearly see how various notes are connected.

## Local Graph 

The local graph allows you to see only parts of the graph that are connected to a specific node. For example, the following image shows a local graph with a depth of 2, which means that only nodes with a distance of up to 2 edges will be displayed. This can be quite helpful for quickly navigating between notes on the same topic.
