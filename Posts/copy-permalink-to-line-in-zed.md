blog-title: Copy Permalink to Line in Zed

Today I learned that you can copy a permanent link to a line of source code in Zed. It's as simple as a right-click and selecting `Copy Permalink` (the last option in the context menu). It will copy a GitHub link to that exact line of code to your clipboard. This is great for sharing an exact location in the codebase with your colleagues.
